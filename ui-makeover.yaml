ui_specification:
  theme_philosophy:
    style: "Cyber-minimal," terminal-inspired data overlays, high-contrast status indicators.
    speed_focus: Real-time socket streaming (for agent outputs), low-latency state changes.
    visual_hierarchy: Emphasizes "Autonomy vs. Intervention." The UI highlights where the Agents are succeeding versus where they need Human help.

  layout_structure:
    global_navigation:
      type: Command Bar (CLI-style dropdown).
      access: Mouse click or keyboard shortcut ('Cmd+K').
      contents: Agent Swarms, Feature Backlogs, Model Configs, API Keys, Logs.
    
    board_view:
      layout: Pipeline Flow (Agent Phases).
      default_columns:
        left: "Icebox" (Stored feature ideas, inactive).
        center: "Spec Definition" (The input zone; features waiting for agent pickup).
        right: "Deployed" (Features successfully merged/deployed).
      column_behavior:
        visibility_logic: 
          - "Spec Definition" is the anchor (always visible).
          - Only one "Active Agent Phase" (e.g., Coding, QA) visible at a time to reduce noise from parallel swarms.
          - "Focus Mode": Clicking an active column creates a split-screen view: Feature Spec (left) vs. Agent Live Output (right).
        custom_columns:
          context: Represents Agent Roles (e.g., Architect, Coder, Reviewer).
          visual_representation: Status bars showing aggregate swarm progress.
      zoom_view:
        trigger: "Inspect Swarm" icon.
        behavior: Enters a node-graph view showing how different agents are collaborating on features in this column.

  column_component:
    properties:
      header: Agent Role Name (e.g., "DevBot-Alpha") and Active Thread Count.
      background_color: State-based (Blue=Idle, Green=Active, Red=Error/Blocked).
    sorting_logic:
      method: Automatic based on "Confidence Score" or "Completion %".
      manual_sorting: Disabled (Agents pull work automatically based on capacity).

  card_component: # Now represents a "Feature"
    anatomy:
      top_left:
        - Feature ID.
        - Token Cost (real-time counter).
        - Model Model (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5).
      center:
        - Feature Title / User Story.
        - Streaming Text Indicator (if agent is currently writing).
      bottom_left:
        - Assigned Swarm/Agent Icon.
      bottom_right:
        - Confidence Score (e.g., 98%).
        - "Human Help Needed" Indicator (Hand icon).
      
    styling_rules:
      background_color: Inherits agent state (pulsing opacity if processing).
      done_state: "Deployed" cards become static/read-only with a link to the Git commit.
      
    special_states:
      golden_ticket: "Priority Compute"
        trigger: User toggles "High Priority."
        visual: Gold border + "GPU" icon.
        behavior: Allocates expensive/smarter models to this feature; jumps queue.
      
      stalled_warning: "Loop Detection"
        trigger: Agent repeats same error or step > X times.
        visual: A "Infinite Loop" icon with a red bubble showing retry count.
        meaning: Agent is stuck/hallucinating; requires human override.
      
      auto_archived: "Garbage Collect"
        trigger: Feature deemed "Not Feasible" by Architect Agent.
        action: Moves to Icebox with an attached "Rejection Reason" report.
        visual: Stamped with "Rejected by System."
    
    interactions:
      drag_and_drop: moving a card to a column forces a specific agent to take over (Manual Override).
      click: Opens "Terminal View" (shows raw agent logs/code diffs).
      hover_activity: overlays the last 3 "Thoughts" or "Reasoning steps" the agent generated.

  global_widgets:
    pinned_stack: "Live Monitors"
      location: Bottom Left Corner.
      function: Watch specific features currently compiling or testing.
      visual: Mini terminal windows.
      behavior: 
        - Shows green/red dots for passing/failing tests in real-time.
        - Click opens full test logs.
    
    notification_stack: "Intervention Queue"
      location: Bottom Right Corner.
      function: Requests for human approval (e.g., "Agent needs permission to execute shell command").
      visual: Stack of alert cards.
      interaction: 
        - "Approve/Deny" buttons directly on the notification edge.
        - 'N' key fans open the queue for bulk approval.

  activity_view: "Swarm Logs"
    structure: Three-column timeline layout.
    columns:
      1: "Prompted" (Human inputs).
      2: "Reasoning" (Internal agent monologues/decisions).
      3: "Actions" (File writes, API calls, CLI commands).
    visuals: 
      - Time gaps represent "latency" or "API rate limiting."
      - Code blocks are syntax highlighted.

  search_and_filter:
    global_search:
      trigger: 'K' key.
      visual: Command palette.
      capabilities: Search code snippets, error logs, or feature titles.
    board_filter:
      location: Top of board.
      function: Filter by Model Used, Cost > $X, or Error Status.

  settings_configuration:
    auto_close_timer: "Timeout Threshold"
      ui: Slider (Seconds/Minutes).
      function: Kills agent process if no output received within time limit.
    public_sharing:
      toggle: "Public Demo Mode."
      output: Read-only view of the feature being built (hides API keys/internal logs).

  keyboard_shortcuts:
    J: Open Command Bar.
    K: Global Log Search.
    N: Toggle Intervention Queue.
    T: Open Terminal/Console view for selected card.
    Space: Pause/Resume active Agent on selected card.
