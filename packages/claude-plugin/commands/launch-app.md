# Launch AgentKanban App

Start the AgentKanban Tauri desktop application in development mode.

Run the following command:

```bash
cd /Users/shakes/DevProjects/agentkanban && pnpm dev
```

Run this command in the background so you can continue working while the app runs.

**Note:** The app runs on `http://127.0.0.1:4000` for the sync server. Make sure no other process is using this port.
